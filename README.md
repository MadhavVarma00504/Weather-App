## Features
- Search weather by city name.
- Displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- 5-day weather forecast.
- User-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Backend programming.
- **Flask**: For creating the web framework.
- **HTML/CSS**: For front-end design and styling.
- **JavaScript**: To manage frontend interaction (if applicable).
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For retrieving real-time weather data.
